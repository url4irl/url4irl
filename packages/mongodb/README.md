# @url4irl/mongodb

MongoDB wrapper that provides a simple interface to interact with MongoDB databases.

This package is a direct dependency of all packages from this repository that need to interact with MongoDB databases.

In the future, this package will be replaced by a more generic package that will allow the use of other databases as well.
